Getting the basics
1. Working with your network interfaces
1.1. ifconfig
1.2. iproute2
2. Routing
2.1. route
2.2. iproute2


List all network interfaces:
	ifconfig -a

List only network interfaces that are UP:
	ifconfig

List all network interfaces with iproute2:
	ip address list
	ip address show
	ip address
	ip a l
	ip a s
	ip a

List all current routes:
	route -n (the -n is for do not resolve IPs)

Adding a routes with route:
	route add -net 192.168.22.0/24 gw 10.2.0.1 dev eth0
	route add -host 10.2.0.128  dev eth0

Adding default gw with route:
	route add default gw 10.2.0.1

List all current routes with iproute2:
	ip route list
	ip route
	ip r l
	ip r

Adding routes with iproute2:
	ip route add 192.168.22.0/24 via 10.2.0.1 dev eth0
	ip r a 192.168.22.0/24 via 10.2.0.1 dev eth0
	ip route add 10.2.0.128 dev eth0
	ip r a 10.2.0.128 dev eth0

Adding default gw with iproute2:
	ip route add 0/0 via 10.2.0.1
	ip r a default via 10.2.0.1

Configure network interface with ifconfig:
	ifconfig eth0 10.2.0.254 netmask 255.255.255.0

Configure network interface with iproute2:
	ip address add 10.2.0.254/24 dev eth0
	ip link set eth0 up
	ip route add 10.2.0.0/24 dev eth0

Looking up your ARP table with arp:
	arp -n

Looking up your ARP table with iproute2:
	ip neigh list
	ip neigh 
	ip n l
	ip n

What is the route that my machine will choose to ip xx.xxx.xx.xxx:
	ip route get xx.xxx.xx.xxx
